# MotionKit -- Opinionated Rapid Application Framework for Mac and iOS using RubyMotion


It's tough getting an application together. We want to get you running _fast_ when you're targeting iOS and Mac platforms at the same time.

You'll need to learn Objective-C and the foundational aspects of Apple's APIs for Mac and iOS devices. And you're a Ruby shop. 

The opportunity to really go fast on these 2 platforms is the reason RubyMotion is so successful. We aim to share and accelerate the layers above that, and your company's mission.

So it's an honour to present to you MotionKit. We model our role after Rails for the server-side Ruby world.
