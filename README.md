# MotionKit -- Opinionated Rapid Application Framework for Mac and iOS using RubyMotion


It's tough getting an application together. We want to get you running _fast_ when you're targeting iOS and Mac platforms at the same time.

You'll need to learn Objective-C and the foundational aspects of Apple's APIs for Mac and iOS devices. If you're a Ruby shop, this mean your road to excellence is going to be quite long-winded. 

The opportunity for teams familiar with Ruby to really go fast on these 2 platforms is the reason RubyMotion is so successful. We aim to share and accelerate the layers we built above RubyMotion, so you can reuse our experience.

So it's an honour to present to you MotionKit. We model our role after Rails for the server-side Ruby world.

## Current status

Things are still being extracted from MotionKit apps such as [WebBuddy][] and [OneHour][] into this project.

If you find any issues, it's likely to be fixed but pending factoring out. Let us know by raising an issue.
